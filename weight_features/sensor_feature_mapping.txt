Sensor-to-Feature Mapping
=========================
Which passive sensors from the dataset can serve as predictors (X-features)
for each EMA-derived psychological construct.

Available sensors in the dataset:
  - conversation   : detected conversation episodes (start/end timestamps)
  - dark           : screen-off / dark periods (start/end)
  - gps            : location (latitude, longitude, speed, bearing, accuracy)
  - phonecharge    : charging periods (start/end)
  - phonelock      : phone lock/unlock periods (start/end)
  - wifi           : nearby wifi networks (BSSID, frequency, signal level)
  - wifi_location  : semantic location labels (e.g. "east-wheelock", "baker-berry")
  - call_log       : phone calls (type, number hash, duration, timestamp)
  - sms            : text messages (type, address hash, timestamp)


================================================================================
1. RESTLESSNESS  (stress, anxiety, not_calm)
================================================================================

  stress → "Right now, I am... [stressed out / feeling good]"
  Relevant sensors:
    - phonelock        : frequent phone checking (short lock/unlock cycles) = agitation
    - dark             : irregular screen-off patterns, late-night phone use
    - gps              : high mobility / erratic movement patterns
    - conversation     : fewer or shorter conversations under stress
    - call_log         : changes in call frequency/duration under stress

  anxiety → "I was anxious, easily upset"
  Relevant sensors:
    - phonelock        : compulsive phone checking (frequent short unlocks)
    - gps              : limited location variety (avoidance) or erratic movement
    - conversation     : reduced social interaction (fewer/shorter conversations)
    - call_log         : fewer outgoing calls, more missed calls
    - sms              : changes in texting patterns (frequency, time of day)

  not_calm → "I was calm, emotionally stable" (inverted)
  Relevant sensors:
    - phonelock        : frequent phone unlocks = lack of calm
    - dark             : disturbed screen-off patterns, less sustained rest
    - gps              : high variability in location / speed


================================================================================
2. IMPULSIVITY  (not_dependable, critical)
================================================================================

  not_dependable → "I was dependable, self-disciplined" (inverted)
  Relevant sensors:
    - phonelock        : excessive phone use (long unlock sessions = distraction)
    - dark             : late-night phone use (poor self-discipline)
    - wifi_location    : skipping expected locations (e.g. missing class)
    - gps              : irregular schedule patterns

  critical → "I was critical, quarrelsome"
  Relevant sensors:
    - call_log         : more calls / longer calls (arguments)
    - sms              : increased messaging frequency (confrontations)
    - conversation     : longer conversation episodes (heated discussions)


================================================================================
3. IRRITABILITY  (critical, not_calm, not_reserved)
================================================================================

  critical → "I was critical, quarrelsome"
  Relevant sensors:
    - call_log         : increased call frequency, longer call durations
    - sms              : burst texting patterns
    - conversation     : longer / more frequent face-to-face conversations

  not_calm → "I was calm, emotionally stable" (inverted)
  Relevant sensors:
    - phonelock        : frequent phone checking
    - gps              : erratic location changes

  not_reserved → "I was reserved, quiet" (inverted)
  Relevant sensors:
    - conversation     : more frequent / longer conversations
    - call_log         : more outgoing calls
    - sms              : more outgoing messages
    - bluetooth        : more nearby devices (socializing in groups)
    - wifi_location    : more time in social locations (dining halls, common areas)


================================================================================
4. INSOMNIA  (poor_sleep_quality, few_hours, daytime_sleepiness)
================================================================================

  poor_sleep_quality → "How would you rate your overall sleep last night?"
  Relevant sensors:
    - dark             : fragmented dark periods at night (waking up)
    - phonelock        : phone unlocks during nighttime hours
    - phonecharge      : irregular charging patterns at night

  few_hours → "How many hours did you sleep last night?"
  Relevant sensors:
    - dark             : total dark duration during night (proxy for sleep duration)
    - phonelock        : last unlock → first unlock = sleep window
    - phonecharge      : overnight charging duration as sleep proxy

  daytime_sleepiness → "Trouble staying awake during the day?"
  Relevant sensors:
    - phonelock        : long lock periods during daytime (phone untouched = napping)
    - dark             : daytime dark episodes (napping with phone face-down)
    - wifi_location    : staying in dorm during class hours
